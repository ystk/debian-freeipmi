  ipmi-chassis-config, ipmi-fru, ipmi-oem, ipmi-raw, ipmi-sel,
  ipmi-sensors, ipmi-sensors-config, ipmiconsole, ipmimonitoring,
  ipmipower, pef-config) to avoid typing common options on the command
  line.  See freeipmi.conf(5) for more information.
o Add hostrange support to all config tools (bmc-config, pef-config,
  ipmi-sensors-config, ipmi-chassis-config) to support parallel
  configuration on a cluster.
o Support --bridge-sensors in ipmi-sensors and ipmimonitoring to 
  access non-BMC owned sensors (experimental).
o Support --sensor-config-file on ipmimonitoring to support 
  alternate interpretation rules.
o Add additional "connection timeout" error message to tools to
  differentiate between no IPMI communication at all vs. session
  timeout in the middle of a command's operations.

o Support --sdr-cache-recreate in all SDR related tools for easier
  scripting.
o Support --guid option in bmc-info to retrieve global ID (guid).

see README.sunbmc for compilation instructions.

Tools - Enhancements/Changes/Bug Fixes
--------------------------------------
o Global in most tools
  - Rename --no-probing option to --disable-auto-probe for consistency
    in FreeIPMI.  Backwards compatability maintained.
o Global in config tools (bmc-config, pef-config, ipmi-sensors-config)
  - More carefully check for fatal vs. non-fatal errors when
    performing configuration.  This change may result in slight
    behavior differences.  For example, a session-timeout may have
    previously been considered a non-fatal error, making the config
    tools continue on attempting more configuration activities.  Now,
    it would error out on the first session-timeout indication.
o ipmi-sensors
  - Check variety of corner cases such as whether sensor readings,
    hysteresis, thresholds, etc. are even available before reading
    them.  Some sensors may output slightly different information than
    before.  For example, suppose a power supply sensor exists for a
    power supply that is not installed.  If the sensor is enabled on
    the motherboard, ipmi-sensors would likely report "OK".  If the
    sensor is disabled on the motherboard, ipmi-sensors would now likely
    report "NA".  Previously, "OK" would have been reported under both
    conditions.
  - Output "NA" for sensors whose slave addresses are not the BMC.
  - Output "Unknown" for sensors whose readings cannot be determined.
  - Output multiple sensor status messages on separate lines, rather
    than all on one line under verbose modes.
  - Output "Unrecognized State" if the sensor specifies a state that is
    unrecognized.
  - Busy sensors are now output with "Unknown" instead of causing
    errors.
  - When fields are not relevant, do not output as much information in
    verbose and very verbose mode.  For example, don't output
    hysteresis or threshold information for power supply sensors.
  - Alter some output ordering for consistency to IPMI spec.
  - Shorten/adjust some state strings for readability under
    non-verbose output.  For example, "Fully Redundant (formerly
    "Redundancy Regained")" is now just "Fully Redundant".
  - Change default privilege from user to operator.
o ipmimonitoring
  - Support -v verbose option to output sensors readings that aren't
    readable.
  - Check corner case for sensor readability.  May lead to slightly
    different output in ipmimonitoring.  For example, suppose a power
    supply sensor exists for a power supply that is not installed.  If
    the sensor is enabled on the motherboard, ipmimonitoring would
    normally report "Nominal".  If the sensor is disabled on the motherboard, 
    ipmimonitoring would normally not output a sensor state (it would
    output "N/A" under verbose mode). Previously, "Nominal" would have
    been reported under both conditions.
  - Consider sensors without BMC slave addresses unreadable.  May
    result in sensors not being output like before.
  - Busy sensors may result in sensors not being output rather than
    causing errors.
  - Output "Unrecognized State" if the sensor specifies a state that is
    unrecognized.
  - Output multiple bitmask strings if multiple bits are set.
  - Output "OK", similarly to ipmi-sensors when no bitmask strings are
    returned from a sensor reading.
  - Shorten/adjust some state strings for readability.  For example,
    "Fully Redundant (formerly "Redundancy Regained")" is now just
    "Fully Redundant".
  - Change default privilege from user to operator.
o ipmipower
  - Removed many early experimental features from ipmipower so
    ipmipower is more like other tools.  Removed ipmi-version,
    cipher-suite-id, privilege-level, and authentication-type auto
    discovery. Removed ability to enable/disable a number of experimental
    features.
  - Changed --config to --config-file in ipmipower for consistency to
    other tools.  Backwards compatability maintiained.
  - Replace --ipmi-version option with --driver-type.  Backwards
    compatability maintained.
  - Removed hostname config file option.  Require users to always input
    atleast hostname.
  - Changed primary config file to /etc/freeipmi.conf.  Legacy config
    file searched for and still supported.
  - Prefixed config file options with 'ipmipower' for consistency to
    new global FreeIPMI config file.  Old options still supported.
o bmc-config
  - Support configuration of UserN:Lan_Session_Limit and
    UserN:Serial_Session_Limit (where N is a user id number).
  - By default, do not output unsupported authentication type enables
    when checking out the Lan_Conf_Auth section.  Output unsupported
    authentication type enables under verbose output.
  - By default, do not output serial configuration parameters on checkout.
    Output serial configuration under verbose output.
  - Remove checkout of "Misc" section and "Power_Restore_Policy"
    field, which is now handled by ipmi-chassis-config.  Backwards
    compatability commit and diff maintained.
  - Remove case sensitivity when checking a number of fields.
o ipmi-chassis
  - Alter ipmi-chassis output to print "unknown" when field is not known.
  - Alter some ipmi-chassis output text to be more consistent to IPMI
    spec.
  - Hide configuration options now supported in ipmi-chassis-config.  
o ipmi-fru
  - Output FRU device names along with IDs in ipmi-fru.
  - Reduce excessive newline outputs in ipmi-fru.
  - Output more information by default.  Change the output of verbose
    vs. very verbose output.
o ipmi-sel
  - Change default privilege from user to operator.
  - Search of SDR records by sensor number and sensor owner id.
  - Support SEL Event Record debug dumping.
o ipmiconsole
  - Support --session-timeout and --retransmission-timeout options.
  - Removed -C short option for consistency to other tools.
  - Removed hostname config file option.  Require users to always input
    atleast hostname.
  - Changed primary config file to /etc/freeipmi.conf.  Legacy config
    file searched for and still supported.
  - Prefixed config file options with 'ipmiconsole' for consistency to
    new global FreeIPMI config file.  Old options still supported.
o bmc-watchdog
  - Remove legacy 'v' option for version.

    consistency with other tools.

  Notable changes.
  1) ipmi_ver_minor and ipmi_ver_major in struct ipmi_locate_info have
     been renamed to ipmi_version_minor and ipmi_version_major.
  2) reg_space/register_space have been renamed to register_spacing globally.
  3) privilege has been replaced to privilege_level globally.
  4) Various library error codes have been renamed for consistency for
     error codes in other libraries.  For example OUTMEM has been
     changed to OUT_OF_MEMORY globally.
  5) Various error codes and messages have been renamed/redone to give
     more useful information.  For example, IPMI_ERR_PRIVILEGE is now
