freeipmi (0.7.17~beta2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fresh (as of 2009/12/07) upstream for 0.7 branch -- includes a few bugfixes
    on top of 0.7.15-2.  This would be probably the last 0.7 release in Debian
    sid (0.8 packaging is on the way).

freeipmi (0.7.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Debian release (closes: #443212)
  * Taking over ITP which had no activity/replies
    - debian/control
      + policy version boost to 3.8.3 from 3.8.0
      + me in maintainer
      + tune up descriptions to my liking
      + added Homepage, Vcs- header fields
      + freeipmi-common to contain common config file + info/man pages
    - debian/copyright
      + list proper copyright holders (not authors)
    - debian/watch -- added
    - debian/*.install -- reverted to install tools under /sbin: nothing
      IPMI-related is destined from poor mortals
    - abandoned quilt -- raw git for now
    - Debian-specific init scripts
  * Fix-up in few manpages (adopted upstream)
