The ganglia scripts can be used to monitor IPMI sensors in ganglia via
FreeIPMI.  Please see instructions found at the top of each script for
instructions.

ganglia_ipmimonitoring.pl
-------------------------

Monitor via FreeIPMI's ipmimonitoring.  This is the recommended script
to use.  It will monitor the state (Nominal, Warning, or Critical) of
all the sensors currently supported by libipmimonitoring(3).  At last
check, the sesnors supported are: temperature, voltage, current, fan,
physical security, platform security violation attempt, processor,
power supply, power unit, memory, drive slot, syste firmware progress,
event logging disabled, system event, critical interrupt, module
board, slot connector, watchdog2, entity presence, management
subsystem health, battery, fru state.

It will also monitor the sensor readings for temperature, fan, and
voltage sensors (i.e. 99.0 C, 130000.00 RPM, 1.2 V).

Monitor via FreeIPMI's ipmi-sensors.  This general script will monitor
temperature, fan, and voltage sensor readings.
