.TH ipmipower 8 "@ISODATE@" "ipmipower @PACKAGE_VERSION@" "System Commands"
.SH "NAME"
ipmipower \- IPMI power control utility
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B ipmipower
[\fIOPTION\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B ipmipower
allows users to remotely power on, off, cycle, hard reset, get a power
status query, perform a pulse diagnostic interrupt, or initiate a
soft-shutdown of the OS via ACPI through the IPMI over LAN protocol.
.LP
When a power command (--on, --off, --cycle, --reset, --stat, --pulse,
or --soft) is specified on the command line,
.B ipmipower 
will attempt to run the power command on all hostnames listed on the
command line then exit.
.LP
If no power commands are specified on the command line, 
.B ipmipower 
will run in interactive mode.  Interactive mode gives the user a
command line interface to enter various commands.  Details of the
interactive command line interface can be found below under
INTERACTIVE COMMANDS.
.LP
See EXAMPLES below for examples of how ipmipower is commonly used.

#include <@top_srcdir@/common/man/manpage-common-general-options-header.man>
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-driver\-type\fR=\fIIPMIDRIVER\fR
Specify the driver type to use instead of doing an auto selection.
The currently available outofband drivers are LAN and LAN_2_0, which
perform IPMI 1.5 and IPMI 2.0 respectively.
#include <@top_srcdir@/common/man/manpage-common-outofband-hostname-hostranged.man>
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-username\fR=\fIUSERNAME\fR
Specify the username to use when authenticating with the remote host.
If not specified, a null (i.e. anonymous) username is assumed.  The
user must have atleast OPERATOR privileges to run the --on, --off,
--reset, --cycle, --pulse, or --soft power control commands.  The user
must have atleast USER privileges to determine the power status of the
machine through --stat.

\fB\-\-rmcpdump\fR
Turn on RMCP packet dump output.  Warning, the dump output can get 
extremely long.
\}

.SH "IPMIPOWER OPTIONS"
The following options are specific to
.B ipmipower.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-on\fR
Power on the target hosts.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-off\fR
Power off the target hosts.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-cycle\fR
Power cycle the target hosts.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-reset\fR
Reset the target hosts.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-stat\fR
Get power status of the target hosts.
.TP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-pulse\fR
Send power diagnostic interrupt to target hosts.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-soft\fR
Initiate a soft-shutdown of the OS via ACPI.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-on\-if\-off\fR
The IPMI specification does not require the power cycle or hard reset
commands to turn on a machine that is currently powered off.  This
option will force
.B ipmipower 
to issue a power on command instead of a power cycle or hard reset
command if the remote machine's power is currently off.
.TP
\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-wait\-until\-on\fR
The IPMI specification allows power on commands to return prior to the
power on actually taking place.  This option will force
.B ipmipower 
to regularly query the remote BMC and return only after the machine
has powered on.
.TP
\fB\-G\fR, \fB\-\-wait\-until\-off\fR
The IPMI specification allows power off commands to return prior the
power off actually taking place.  This option will force
.B ipmipower 
to regularly query the remote BMC and return only after the machine
has powered off.

.SH "IPMIPOWER ADVANCED NETWORK OPTIONS"
The following options are used to change the networking behavior of
.B ipmipower.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-retransmission\-wait\-timeout\fR=\fBMILLISECONDS\fR
Specify the retransmission wait timeout length in milliseconds.  The
retransmission wait timeout is similar to the retransmission timeout
above, but is used specifically for power completion verification with
the \fB\-\-wait\-until\-on\fR and \fB\-\-wait\-until\-off\fR options.
Defaults to 500 milliseconds (0.5 seconds).
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-retransmission\-backoff\-count\fR=\fBCOUNT\fR
Specify the retransmission backoff count for retransmissions.  After
ever COUNT retransmissions, the retransmission timeout length will be
increased by another factor.  Defaults to 8.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-ping\-interval\fR=\fBMILLISECONDS\fR
Specify the ping interval length in milliseconds.  When running in
interactive mode, RMCP (Remote Management Control Protocol) discovery
messages will be sent to all configured remote hosts every
MILLISECONDS to confirm their support of IPMI.  Power commands cannot
be sent to a host until it is discovered (or re-discovered if
previously lost).  Defaults to 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds).  Ping
discovery messages can be disabled by setting this valu to 0.  RMCP
ping discovery messages are automatically disabled in non-interactive
mode.
.TP
\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-ping\-timeout\fR=\fBMILLISECONDS\fR
Specify the ping timeout length in milliseconds.  When running in
interactive mode, RMCP (Remote Management Control Protocol) messages
discovery will be sent to all configured remote hosts to confirm their
support of IPMI. A remote host is considered undiscovered if the host
does not respond in MILLISECONDS time.  Defaults to 30000 milliseconds
(30 seconds).  The ping timeout cannot be larger than the ping interval.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-ping\-packet\-count\fR=\fBCOUNT\fR
Specify the ping packet count size.  Defaults to 10.  See the
\fB\-\-ping-percent\-fR option below for more information on this
option.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-ping\-percent\fR=\fBPERCENT\fR
Specify the ping percent value.  Defaults to 50.

Since IPMI is based on UDP, it is
difficult for
.B ipmipower
to distinguish between a missing machine and a bad (or heavily loaded)
network connection in interactive mode.  when running in interactive
mode.  For example, suppose a link consistently drops 80% of the
packets to a particular machine.  The power control operation may have
difficulty completing, although a recent pong response from RMCP makes
.B ipmipower 
believe the machine is up and functioning properly.

The ping packet acount and percent options are used to alleviate this
problem.
.B Ipmipower 
will monitor RMCP ping packets in packet count chunks.  If
.B ipmipower 
does not receive a response to greater than ping percent of those
packets,
.B ipmipower 
will assume the link to this node is bad and will not send power
control operations to that node until the connection is determined to
be reliable.  This heuristic can be disabled by setting either the
ping packet count or ping percent to 0.  This feature is not used if
ping interval is set to 0.
.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-ping\-consec\-count\fR=\fBCOUNT\fR
Specify the ping consecutive count.  This is another heuristic used to
determine if a node should be considered discovered, undiscovered, or
with a bad connection.  If a valid RMCP pong response was received for
the last COUNT ping packets, a node will be considered discovered,
regardless of other heuristics listed above.  Defaults to 5.  This
heuristic can be disabled by setting this value to 0.  This feature is
not used if other ping features described above are disabled.

control operations that can be executed in parallel.

.SH "IPMIPOWER TROUBLESHOOTING"
When powering on a powered off machine, the client must have a means
by which to resolve the MAC address of the remote machine's ethernet
card.  This is typically done in one of two ways.
.LP
1) Enable gratuitous ARPs on the remote machine.  The remote machine
will send out a gratuitous ARP, which advertises the ethernet IP and
MAC address so that other machines on the network this information
their local ARP cache.  For large clusters, this method is not
recommended since gratuitous ARPs can flood the network with
unnecessary traffic.
.LP
2) Permanently store the remote machine's MAC address in the local ARP
cache.  This is the more common approach on large clusters.
.LP
Other methods are listed in the IPMI specification.
.LP
If 
.B ipmipower 
is running a tad slow when running a power control command on the
commandline (compared to running a power control command in
interactive mode), hostname IP resolution may be slowing the startup
code down.  Hostname resolution tuning may help make
.B ipmipower 
execute faster on the commandline.  This performance problem should
not matter when running in interactive mode or with
.B powerman, 
since it is a one-time setup cost.

#include <@top_srcdir@/common/man/manpage-common-workaround-heading-text.man>
#include <@top_srcdir@/common/man/manpage-common-workaround-text.man>
#include <@top_srcdir@/common/man/manpage-common-known-issues.man>
.LP
IPMI specifications do not require BMCs to perform a power control
operation before returning a completion code to the caller.
Therefore, it is possible for
.B ipmipower 
to return power status queries opposite of what you are expecting.
For example, if a "power off" operation is performed, a BMC may return
a successful completion code to
.B ipmipower
before the "power off" operation is actually performed.  Subsequent
power status queries may return "on" for several seconds, until the
BMC actually performs the "power off" operation.
.LP
.if @WITH_DEBUG@ \{
This version of ipmipower was compiled with debugging.  When compiled
with debugging,
.B ipmipower 
is insecure.  The following were intentionally
left in
.B ipmipower
for debugging purposes:
.LP
.IP o 2
Sensitive command line arguments are not cleared from memory.
.IP o
Core dumps are enabled.
.IP o
In interactive mode, commands may output sensitive information
to stdout.
.LP
Before placing ipmipower in a production system, it is recommended
that the program be compiled with debugging turned off.
