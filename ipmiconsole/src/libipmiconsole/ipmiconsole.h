/* 
 * Workaround Flags
 *
 * Utilized with struct ipmiconsole_ipmi_config below to specify
 * workarounds for specific motherboard manufacturers.
 * 
 * AUTHENTICATION_CAPABILITIES
 *
 * Discoverd on an ASUS P5M2 motherboard, the motherboard does not
 * properly report username capabilities or K_g status, leading to
 * invalid username or K_g errors.  This workaround flag will work
 * around the problem.  This problem is also confirmed on an ASUS
 * P5MT-R.
 *
 * IGNORE_SOL_PAYLOAD_SIZE
 *
 * Discovered on an ASUS P5M2 motherboard, the motherboard reports
 * invalid SOL payload sizes.  This workaround flag will ignore the
 * payload size and choose a reasonable default.
 *
 * IGNORE_SOL_PORT
 *
 * Discovered on an ASUS P5MT-R motherboard, the motherboard reports
 * an invalid SOL port.  This workaround flag will ignore the invalid
 * port and continue with the default.
 *
 * SKIP_SOL_ACTIVATION_STATUS
 *
 * Discovered on Supermicro X8SIL-F motherboard, the motherboard does
 * not support the Get Payload Activation Status command.  This
 * workaround flag will skip that portion of the protocol and pray for
 * the best.
 *
 * INTEL_2_0_SESSION
 *
 * All currently known IPMI 2.0 implementations on Intel motherboards
 * contain a number of authentication bugs.  They include username
 * padding bugs, RAKP 4 integrity check values calculation bugs, and
 * password truncation if the authentication algorithm is
 * HMAC-MD5-128.  This workaround flag will allow the library to
 * authenticate with an Intel motherboard.
 *
 * Security Note: When the Integrity Algorithm is MD5-128 (Cipher
 * Suite ID 11 & 12), the integrity check value of a RAKP 4 packet
 * response is not tested, it is automatically accepted.  The other
 * integrity algorithms (None, HMAC-SHA1, HMAC-MD5) have been reverse
 * engineered for this non-compliance bug, however straight forward
 * MD5-128 has not yet been reverse engineered.
 *
 * SUPERMICRO_2_0_SESSION
 *
 * There are several small IPMI compliance issues on early Supermicro
 * IPMI SOL implementations.  Most involve the authentication codes
 * returned during the RAKP2 portion of authentication.  This
 * workaround flag will get around the problem.  These compliance bugs
 * are confirmed to be fixed on newer firmware.
 *
 * SUN_2_0_SESSION
 *
 * Work around several IPMI 2.0 compliance problems, mostly involving
 * invalid lengthed hash keys and unsupported payload types.
 *
 * Note: The non-logical bitmask order below is set for consistency of
 * masks with libfreeipmi bitmasks.

/* 
 * Engine Flags
 *
 * Utilized with struct ipmiconsole_engine_config below to alter
 * libipmiconsole engine behavior.
 * 
 * CLOSE_FD
 *
 * By default, the ipmiconsole engine will not close the file
 * descriptor (returned by ipmiconsole_ctx_fd()) when an error occurs
 * within the ipmiconsole engine (such as a session timeout).  A user
 * will subsequently see an EOF on a read() or an EPIPE on a write()
 * to know an error occurred.
 *
 * This flag will inform the engine to close the file descriptor on
 * error.  This will change the behavior of how the user should
 * program with the file descriptor.  For example, calls to read() and
 * write() would likely return with EBADF errors instead of EOF or
 * EPIPE errors respectively.  Calls to select() may return with EBADF
 * errors and calls to poll() could result in POLLNVAL returned
 * events.
 *
 * OUTPUT_ON_SOL_ESTABLISHED
 *
 * When submitting a context to the engine non-blocking, another way
 * to determine if the SOL session has been established is if data has
 * output from the remote console and is available for you to read.
 * Under most circumstances, this isn't a controllable situation.
 *
 * This flag will inform the engine to output a single NUL character
 * ('\0') to the console once a SOL session has been established.  If
 * the CLOSE_FD flag isn't used above, this would allow the user to
 * expect an EOF vs. 1 byte of data on a read() to determine if the
 * SOL session has failed or succeeded.  The user may choose to output
 * the NUL anyways (it should do no harm) or simply throw out the
 * first byte ever read from remote console.
 *
 * LOCK_MEMORY
 *
 * Inform libipmiconsole to lock memory to prevent sensitive
 * information (such as usernames and passwords) to be non-swappable.
 *

/* 
 * Behavior Flags
 *
 * Utilized with struct ipmiconsole_protocol_config below to atler
 * SOL connection behavior.
 * 
 * ERROR_ON_SOL_INUSE
 *
 * Under most circumstances, if SOL is detected as being in use,
 * libipmiconsole will attempt to deactivate the earlier SOL session
 * and activate the SOL session under the current one.  This default
 * behavior exists for several reasons, most notably that earlier SOL
 * sessions may have not been able to be deactivate properly.  This
 * security flag changes the default behavior to return an error if
 * SOL is already detected as being in use.  If it is detected as in
 * use, the errnum returned from ipmiconsole_ctx_errnum() would be
 * IPMICONSOLE_ERR_SOL_INUSE.

 *

 * function can return prior to a SOL session being established.  A
 * return value of 0 indicates the context was submitted properly.  A
 * return value of -1 indicates an error occurred during the
 * submission.  On an error, ipmiconsole_ctx_errnum() can be used to
 * determine the type of error that occured.
 *
 * After a context has been submitted, the user may determine if a SOL
 * session has been established several ways:
 *
 * A) Poll on the context status, retrieved via
 * ipmiconsole_ctx_status().  On an error, ipmiconsole_ctx_errnum()
 * can be used to determine the specific IPMI related error that
 * occurred.
 *
 * B) Poll on the context file descriptor, retrieved via
 * ipmiconsole_ctx_fd().  A SOL establishment error will result in an
 * EOF being returned on the file descriptor.  A proper SOL
 * establishment can be determined via a readable character on the
 * file descriptor.  The use of the OUTPUT_ON_SOL_ESTABLISHED Engine
 * flag above can aid in this.  the CLOSE_FD Engine flag can be set to
 * slightly alter this behavior, please see above. On an error,
 * ipmiconsole_ctx_errnum() can be used to determine the specific IPMI
 * related error that occurred.
 *
 * C) Specify a callback function.  The callback function specified as
 * a parameter below will be called directly after a SOL session has
 * been established or an error has occurred.  Within those callback
 * functions, ipmiconsole_ctx_status() can be used to determine which
 * has occurred.
 *
 * Due to the non-blocking semantics of this function, it is possible
 * that multiple errors could occur simultaneously and the errnum
 * retrieved via ipmiconsole_ctx_errnum() may not be the one that
 * caused the SOL session to fail.  However, this will not occur given
 * proper usage of the API.  For example, if the user called
 * ipmiconsole_engine_submit() twice with the same context, an SOL
 * error in the engine background could race with the setting of the
 * errnum IPMICONSOLE_ERR_CTX_IS_SUBMITTED in the second call.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 * callback
 *  
 *   If specified, a callback function will be called from the engine
 *   when a SOL session has been established or a SOL establishment
 *   error has occurred.  Will only be called under a non-blocking
 *   engine submission via ipmiconsole_engine_submit().  Will be
 *   called once and only once during an individual engine submission.
 *   For example, if a SOL session is established then a later session
 *   timeout occurs, the later session timeout will not generate a
 *   function call to the callback.  Pass NULL for no callback.
 *
 *   The callback function can be called simultaneously from different
 *   engine threads.  It is the user's responsibility to protect
 *   against any race conditions in their callback function.
 *
 * callback_arg
 *
 *   Specify an arbitrary argument to be passed to the callback
 *   routine.  If the callback will be required to process the context
 *   status, the context should be included in this argument.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success, -1 on error.
