\fIassumemaxsdrrecordcount\fR - This workaround will inform SDR
reading to stop reading after a known maximum numer of SDR records
have been read.  This will work around systems that have
mis-implemented SDR reading functions that.  Those hitting this issue
may see "SDR record count invalid" errors.  Issue observed on
unspecified Inspur motherboard.
