libfreeipmi
-----------
* how to support xRC4 (can we? should we? does any vendor support this?)
* abstract FRU parsing into lib?
* abstract SEL parsing into lib?

sunbmc driver
-------------
untested - need solaris hardware

ipmi-chassis-config
-------------------
* conf.5 manpage
- panel button config (need to test against hardware)

general
-------
beginning doc for developers
event handling
try and consolidate checks/etc code in ipmipower/ipmiconsole/api
-x option for excluding hosts??
firmware firewall support?
- new config tool??

config
------
config file - support workarounds/etc. for heterogenous cluster?

bmc-device
--------
get auxiliary log status
- not tested, don't have a machine with this support

pef-config
-----------
* conf.5 manpage

inband code
-----------
retry/resent code?

ipmimonitoring
--------------
power supply state (assert = good)
drive slot predictive failure (deasserted == good)
drive slot state (hdd.ok2rm - assert == good?)
acpi power state
button
button state
entity prescenc3e

ipmi-sensors-config
-------------------
* conf.5 manpage
* instructions for each section??

IPv6
----
- well, IPMI only supports IPv4, so I suppose there is no need for
this for now.  Just watch for it in the future.

ipmb
----
ipmi 2.0 bridging - untested
openipmi ipmb - untested

libs
----
merge all libs into one?  would aid debian packaging.
- make package layout simpler?
- make .so-naming consistent?
- merge all except libipmidetect?

DCMI functionality
------------------
http://www.intel.com/technology/product/DCMI/index.htm
- new FreeIPMI tool? or separate project? or contrib project?
  - probably a contrib project
- nothing special as a whole, mostly already IPMI 2.0 with a few new
additions.
- get dcmi capabilities info
  - the typical what is dcmi supported and version info junk
- get asset tag
  - seems useless.  gets asset tag, but the asset tag is already
    stored in the FRU (and output via normal FRU output in ipmi-fru.)
  - if supported, make ipmi-fru stuff into lib or steal code 
    from ipmi-fru for parsing.
- get dcmi sensor info command
  - seems useless, only gets the SDR #s of specific sensors
    DCMI cares about?  But sensors already should be output by
    ipmi-sensors/ipmimonitoring/etc.
- get power reading
- get power limit
- set power limit
- activate/deactive power limit
  - these 4 commands seem like the only maybe potentially useful
    additions.

0.7.0 porting ensure works
--------------------------
BSD
- gethostbyname_r - still compiles
- autoconf - no argp-standalone - config errors w/ argp library not found. argp-standalone required
- autoconf - finds argp-standalone
