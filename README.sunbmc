In order to compile the sunbmc driver, the bmc_intf.h header file must
be in your include path.  This can be added by to the include search
path by adding the path to the CPPFLAGS environment variable.  i.e.

in bash

export CPPFLAGS="-I/my/bmc_intf_path/"

in csh/tcsh

setenv CPPFLAGS "-I/my/bmc_intf_path/"

If the file is not on your system, the bmc_intf.h file may simply be
downloaded from opensolaris.org and installed into any location.
